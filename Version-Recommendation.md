For versions, we recommend you using the newest version as the functions in there are more easier to use.



# BETAS


We highly suggest NOT to use Betas because some of the functions might still have errors for other users. Full Versions of CBL are the recommended ones.


# Downloading older Versions


Some older versions are still in store but it will not really be that kid friendly. 
We will also start deleting older versions like CBL 1.0 to ensure that everyone is up to date with the latest functions.

REMEMBER: We always want our users to have a kid friendly functions to ensure kids can understand programming
