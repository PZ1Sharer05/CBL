CBL is a libary with built in functions that allow for automation and simplicity in programming. 
We need to also have CBL in different groups, such as the math module and the standard library.
The reason why we have them in seperate files is because that we want to organize CBL and make sure that the whole file is too messy.
# What is the math module / cblmath
CBLMath is a smaller branch of the CBL Standard library, we try to make it useful for math-related operations.
# CBL Standard Library
CBL Standard is the parent of the whole thing, it has alot of functions that are really useful in terms of automation.
